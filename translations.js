Tout ce qu'on vous dit, c'est qu'<strong>un humain se cache parmi les machines</strong>, et il doit être démasqué.<br><br>À chaque tour, une question ouverte est posée. Un par un, chaque participant, IA et humain, répond à voix haute. Puis vient le vote : <strong>chacun choisit qui il pense être l'humain</strong>. Celui qui a le plus de voix est éliminé. Pour toujours.<br><br>Votre mission ?<br><strong>Répondre comme une machine</strong>. Penser comme une machine. Et faire tout ce que vous pouvez pour éviter d'être découvert<br><br>🤖 <strong>De vraies IA, des comportements uniques</strong><br>Les androïdes ne suivent pas de scripts. Ils sont alimentés <strong>en temps réel</strong> par de vrais modèles de langage. Le texte et la voix sont générés à la volée. Cela signifie que chaque jeu est unique et imprévisible. Vous ne jouez pas contre des bots ou des scripts préécrits. <strong>Vous jouez contre de vraies intelligences artificielles</strong>.",

    modal_rpgLLM_description: "Ce projet de mémoire (réalisé en 5 mois) explore comment les <strong>grands modèles de langage (LLMs)</strong> peuvent être utilisés pour générer des aventures de <strong>jeu de rôle (RPG)</strong> dynamiques, immersives et <strong>personnalisées</strong>. J'ai développé une application dans Unity où les joueurs peuvent plonger dans une expérience entièrement générée par IA, tant en termes de narration que de visuels.<br><br><strong>🧠 Chaque IA agit comme un maître de jeu</strong>, capable de s'adapter aux choix du joueur, de générer des dialogues riches, des situations complexes et de garder l'histoire cohérente et engageante.<br><br>🎨 <strong>Les joueurs sont libres de choisir l'univers qu'ils veulent explorer</strong> : un monde médiéval inspiré de Donjons & Dragons, une épopée spatiale comme Star Wars, ou même une aventure totalement absurde avec Bob l'éponge ; tout est possible. L'IA ajuste l'histoire, les personnages et les événements pour correspondre au style et au ton sélectionnés.<br><br>🖼️ <strong>Pour enrichir l'expérience</strong>, des images générées par IA illustrent les lieux clés, les personnages et les moments de l'histoire, rendant le voyage encore plus immersif et visuellement engageant.<br><br>Ce mémoire nous a permis de faire énormément de mesures intéressantes, autant sur les temps de réponses des requêtes, les techniques d'influence de prompts, les coûts des LLMs ou encore les limites (ex : stéréotype de genre).
